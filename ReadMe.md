# Degis Staking Contracts

_This repo is still developing_

Currently the basic tokens and purchase incentive vault are available.

The staking for Degis and Degis-XXX LP token will be online later.

## How to participate in purchase incentive program?

1. When users buy insurance products on Degis, they will get buyer tokens depending on the USD value thay spent.

2. Users can stake their buyer tokens into PurchaseIncentiveVault.

3. Every round there will be a certain amount of Degis token distributed and the interval for each round is ~24h.(The amount and interval may be changed later by community)

4. The distribution process will be done by the backend.

5. After each round's distribution, users' DEG reward will be updated and they need to manually claim.
