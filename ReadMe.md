# Degis Staking Contracts

Currently the buyer token and purchase incentive vault are available.

The staking for Degis and Degis-XXX LP token will be online later.

## How to participate in purchase incentive program

1. When you buy insurance products on Degis, you will get buyer tokens depending on the USD value you spent.

2. You can stake the buyer tokens in PurchaseIncentiveVault.

3. Every round there will be a certain amount of Degis token distributed and the interval for each round is ~24h.

4. We will do the distribution for you. (IF you want to manually claim, there are also functions)
